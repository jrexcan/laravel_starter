## Theme
This starter kit provides a light/dark mode and custom theme functionality provided by the powerful PrimeVue theming system, using styled mode and custom design token values.

The starting point for customizing your theme will be the `resources\js\Modules\theme-preset.mjs` module file. To quickly change the look and feel of your theme, swap the [primary](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#primary) values with a different set of [colors](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#colors), change the [surface](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#surface) `colorScheme` values (slate, gray, neutral, etc.), or completely change the [preset theme](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/#presets) (Aura used by default).

Please reference the [PrimeVue Styled Mode Docs](https://primevue.org/theming/styled/) to fully understand how this system work, and how to further customize your theme to make it your own.

## PrimeVue v4 w/ Tailwind CSS
If you have used a previous version of this project using PrimeVue v3, you'll know that Tailwind was removed in favor of PrimeFlex. With v4 however, the PrimeTek team has officially suggested [Moving from PrimeFlex to Tailwind CSS](https://primevue.org/guides/primeflex/).

For this reason, Tailwind has been added back into the project and is utilized with the [tailwindcss-primeui](https://primevue.org/tailwind/#plugin) plugin. CSS layers have also been implemented so the Tailwind utilities can [override](https://primevue.org/tailwind/#override) the PrimeVue component styling when needed.
